Self Addressing DRAM 
A mechanism for symboli addressing of DRAM.
Addresses like "hi", "bye", "gone" can be used to address a structure created
in DRAM. Sadram embeds the appropriate login in the DRAM to perform the translation
from symbolic addresses to normal linear addresses automaticly.
Many convenient facilities can be added from this simple beginning, like:
   - sort
   - inram databases
   - matrix operations based upon keys instead of position
